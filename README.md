# sd-web-ui-quickcss

UPDATE 2022/12/19: Now has local imports.

I just setup a quick css apply using the style here https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/discussions/5813

Theme and images included are from that discussion. They are not my work. I just made the tool for them to play with their work.

goto extension and install from url
https://github.com/Gerschel/sd-web-ui-quickcss

Put different css files in style_choices folder in extension (might create a copy to folder from filepath)
Put different logos (png format) in logos folder in extensions directory.
Put different favicons (svg format) in favicons directory.
It's that easy.
If you have a `user.css` it will take precedence over style.css if they have matching elements.
